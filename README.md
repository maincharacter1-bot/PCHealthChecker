# PCHealthChecker
The PC Health Check project is a set of scripts and utilities designed to perform a comprehensive check of a Windows-based PC. The purpose of this project is to automate the process of diagnosing and resolving common issues that can cause a PC to slow down, freeze, or crash. 
A PowerShell script to check the health of the PC's hardware components, including CPU, RAM, hard drive, and graphics card.
A batch file to clean up temporary files, browser cache, and other unnecessary data.
A PowerShell script to uninstall unwanted software and disable unnecessary startup items.
A Python script to perform a malware scan using a popular antivirus software.
A GUI interface to run and manage all of the above scripts and utilities in a single place.
The PC Health Check project aims to be a one-stop-shop for performing regular maintenance on Windows-based PCs, making it easier for users to keep their machines running smoothly and free of common issues.

I hope this example project helps! Feel free to modify it as needed to fit your specific interests and goals as a computer technician.
